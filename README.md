TikTok Scenario Background

At TikTok, our goal is to ignite creativity and bring joy to users. Our employees are renowned for their curiosity and ability to adapt quickly to cultural changes. In a well-structured corporate environment, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to have a real impact on the company's rapid growth and develop your career.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain questionable claims. These reports aim to identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large volume of user reports and is challenging to handle in a timely manner.

TikTok is developing a predictive model that can identify whether a video contains a claim or is simply an opinion. With a successful predictive model in place, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritise handling them more efficiently.

Project Background

TikTok's data team was working on a claims classification project. Before the team can begin the data analysis process, the following steps must be completed:

Data Exploration and Data Cleaning (EDA): Analyse the data to understand its characteristics and data hygiene. This process involves understanding the variables and cleaning the data where necessary.

Visualisation Type Selection and Construction: Selecting the most appropriate type of visualisation to present the data effectively. The team should build visualisations that are relevant to the project objectives and the data at hand.

Creation of Plots to Visualise Variables and Relationships Between Variables: Creating graphical plots that highlight relevant variables and the relationships between them. This helps in better understanding the data and patterns that may exist.

Sharing Results with the TikTok Team: After conducting the data analysis and visualising the findings, the results should be shared with the TikTok team. This allows for better collaboration between team members and ensures relevant information is conveyed.

By going through these steps, the TikTok data team will be ready to continue the data analysis process further and take the necessary steps to improve claim classification on the platform.
